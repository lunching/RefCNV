# RefCNV
<b>RefCNV<b> is a novel approach for the identification of copy number variants from whole exome sequencing data. The algorithm is empirically based, and allows for local adjustment for differences in sequence read coverage across genomic regions. The method is based on establishing a set of normal reference controls.
